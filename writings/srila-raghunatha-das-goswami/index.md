Srila Raghunatha das Goswami, our prayojana acharya, is renowned for his humility.

“Humility means that one should not be anxious to have the satisfaction of being honored by others. The material conception of life makes us very eager to receive honor from others, but from the point of view of a man in perfect knowledge—who knows that he is not this body—anything, honor or dishonor, pertaining to this body is useless. One should not be hankering after this material deception.” BG 13.8 – 12

Feeling attracted and indebted by Srila Raghunatha’s humility, Lord Caitanya presented to him a Govardhan-sila and Gunja Mala. As Raghunatha accepted these gifts, he thought, “By giving me this Govardhan Sila, Lord Caitanya is giving me residence at Govardhan Hill. And by presenting to me this Gunja Mala, my Lord is giving me eternal loving service to Srimati Radharani.”

Amongst Lord Caitanya's confidential associates, Srila Raghunatha das Goswami is especially merciful to the perfected devotee. Lord Caitanya entrusts Srila Raghunatha with the service of prayojana acharya who instructs the perfected devotee in pure love of God.

In his service as prayojana acharya, Raghunatha das Goswami accepts our Prayojana Murti as his patron Deity. “Sri Srila Gopinatha, who originated the transcendental mellow of the rasa dance, stands on the shore in Vamsivaṭa and attracts the attention of the cowherd damsels with the sound of His celebrated flute. May they all confer upon us their benediction.” CC Adi-lila 1.17

Thus Srila Raghunath das Goswami and Gopinath collaboratively confer upon the perfected devotee pure love of God.
