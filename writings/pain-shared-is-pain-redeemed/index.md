Becoming overwhelmed by fears and insecurities and paralyzed by our own pain may be a sign that proper vaisnava relations are deficient. Pain however, can be an effective guide. It can teach us where to turn or where to reach, where to touch and be touched.

Loving relationships between devotees are essential to progressive spiritual growth. Opening the heart in confidence and caring for each other are important aspects of such exchanges. They can be therapeutic and illuminating, for pain shared is pain redeemed. Furthermore, they touch the heart deeply, dispelling all the pain and sorrow, fear and discouragement.

Loving interactions for the sake of Krishna's satisfaction are so pleasing to Him, that it makes His mercy and His loving kindness a tangible reality in our life and consciousness. Ultimately, it is Krishna's love, which is healing, inspiring and redemptive.
