"The moon tower standing at Govardhan between Syama kunda and Lalita kunda awards a bird's eye view of a significant portion of the dham. The tower offers a variety of services to both the Deities and to Their devotees as they take turns watching over one another. It signifies our watchful and yearning search of the countryside for indications of Krishna's pastimes. In reciprocation, Sri Sri Radha Gopinath and Ananga Manjari spend time in the moon tower on nice days when the wind is not strong and remind us of Their watchful and yearning search for indications of our return home.

An unfinished tower is inauspicious, signifying an unfulfilled existence. Completing a tower represents an auspicious change of fortune such as a transformation from crisis to redemption or else attainment of proper consciousness.

Although the moon tower at Govardhan has long stood in unfinished form, it has just been completed by Syama Kunda das, one of the pioneers of New Vrindaban who either built or assisted in building many of the initial structures in New Vrindaban. The completed moon tower is Dham Sevaâ€™s collective offering to the Daughter of King Vrshabhanu on Her birthday, Radhastami."
