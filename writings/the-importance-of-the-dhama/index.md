For Gaudiya Vaisnavas, “back to home” means specifically Vrindavan or Navadwip Dhama (not Vaikuntha, Dwarka, Ayodya, or even Mathura). Prema-sankirtan, which descends from Goloka Vrindavan, is both the means and the goal of entrance into Vraja. Prema-sankirtan is the continuous chanting of the Holy Names of Sri Sri Radha and Krishna:

Hare Krishna Hare Krishna
Krishna Krishna Hare Hare
Hare Rama Hare Rama
Rama Rama Hare Hare

For the development of prema-bhakti, the importance of the dhama here on this Earth planet cannot be over-emphasized. In fact, vraja-bhakti is as unique to this earthly mortal realm as it is distinct in Goloka Vrindavan. Even Lord Chaitanya Mahaprabhu, the most magnanimous appearance of Lord Krishna Who distributed prema (love of God) through the chanting of the Holy Name, did not extend His movement beyond the Earth.

After maturing in sadhana, a devotee comes to the Earth planet within whatever universe Krishna’s bhauma lila is currently manifest. In the association of Brijabasis in Bhauma Vrindavan, the devotee attains the qualification for returning to Krishna’s abode. Thus birth on Earth is a prerequisite for developing prema-bhakti and establishing a connection to Gokula Vrindavan (Krishna’s homeland in the spiritual sky).

In the Vedic scriptures, there are significant references to Bhauma Vrindavan spanning all four yugas. These references further attest to the import, quality, and character of the holy dham on this Earth planet.

The earliest Puranic account of Bhauma Vrindavan is the conversation between Lord Varaha and His consort Mother Earth. The Puranas report that the forests of Vrindavan remained unaffected even as the Earth was plunged into the Garbhodaka Ocean.

This reference attests to the import, quality, and character of the Bhauma Vrindavan and Her expansions on this Earth planet. Furthermore, it nourishes our desire to return to our eternal homeland, Krishna’s eternal Abode of Vraja, through continuous chanting of His Holy Names:

Also, the child Dhruva, the great-grandson of Brahma, took shelter of Vraja dham on Earth while performing tapasya for six months as instructed by his guru Narada Muni. Srimad Bhagavatam 4.8.62 characterizes Madhuvan in Vraja as being "always imprinted with the lotus footprints of Lord Krishna and which is therefore especially auspicious."

Scriptural references to Bhauma Vrindavan attest to the truth that a devotee attains the qualification for returning to Gokula Vrindavan (Krishna’s abode in the spiritual sky) only by taking birth on Earth and associating with Brijabasis in Bhauma Vrindavan or Her expansions. This is one reason why the Gaudiya Vaisnava sampradaya places such great emphasis on dham seva (service to Krishna’s Abode).
