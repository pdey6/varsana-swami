The gifts of nature have a sacramental aspect; they point to something beyond themselves. In this light, food is more than just sustenance to the body; water is more then to quench our thirst, and air is more then something to breathe, they are sacraments. Water is a metaphor for rasa, loving exchange; food is bhakti, nourishment for the soul, and breath is the metaphor for the most essential subsistence, the Holy Name, the very breath of life.
