The great souls teach us, and show by example, how devotees must interact with one another and with the whole environment, in order to evoke the divine nature (Yoga-maya) to reveal herself as she is. Until we are deeply steeped in an attitude of humility, we need to respect the concept of the inferior (Maha-maya) nature as the response of Durga, Mother Parvati to our rebellious mentality, our desire to enjoy, control and exploit.

We need to practice here and now how to rectify this mentality and interact with everything as being essentially, inherently divine, acknowledging and respecting that the inferior nature has a divine face. In so doing, we will gradually perceive Yoga-maya's enlightening aspect taking precedence over her inferior and deluding feature. Assuming the role of mother, she prepares us for going back to the land, where there is no false ego, no sense of proprietorship; where service is the predominant mentality directing the lives and activities of both the Lord and His servants.
