The departed acaryas and great vaisnavas are not frozen in time; their mercy is still attainable. It is as attainable as are all spiritual existences, which are by nature eternal, full of knowledge and bliss. Furthermore, their samadhis are imbued with the divine energy that washes away the anarthas and brings light into our hearts. They are more accessible on the auspicious day of their appearance or disappearance, because of the sanctity, which accompanies that occasion. Such days offer special opportunity to remember those great souls, pray to them and glorify their transcendental qualities, which in turn evokes their satisfaction followed by their blessings. As our depth of appreciation for their qualities, sacrifices and examples of selfless service becomes enriched and our fortitude to sincerely follow in their footsteps strengthens, the opportunity to receive the benediction of their eternal association opens.

**************

Any tangible connection we claim with previous acaryas is only through the link established with our own spiritual master and the present vaisnavas. There is a subtle difference in goal and effect in a chanting of an uninitiated aspirant compare to an initiated devotee. For an uninitiated devotee chanting the holy name awards eligibility for Sri Guruâ€™s grace in the formality of initiation; once initiated the aspiration of chanting is Krishna prema.
