The mind is supposed to be under the guidance of intelligence, which is supposed to adhere to the dictates of the soul, the servant of the Supersoul. However, in the material world everything is backwards and upside down. Thus the conditioned soul follows the orders of the senses, which dictate to the mind, which dictate to the intelligence, which dictates to the soul, who dictates to the Supersoul.

And when the Lord in the heart gives it's wise counsel and loving advice “You are going to suffer if you pursue this course” and the jiva persistently rebels, the Supersoul says: “You are on your own. I am with you, but I will remain silent until you again call upon my guidance”.
