When others hurt, insult us or attack our reputation (on another level, it is the material nature trying to seduce us into the lower modes) forgiveness is our protection. If we succumb to false ego, hold grudges or refuse to extend forgiveness to others, how can we expect that Krishna will forgive us for our unlimited sins, offenses and lifetimes of aversion to Him? Furthermore, the Lord bestows His mercy when those who are near and dear to Him appeal on our behalf. Answering their prayers Krishna forgives us, restoring and fortifying our devotional life by the ultimate power in all the creation â€“ His divine grace
