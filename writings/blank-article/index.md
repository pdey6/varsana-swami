Tundavik, the resident peacock of Radha-kunda who is devoted to delivering fresh feathers for Gopinath’s turban, patiently oversaw Lalita’s planting of flowers (photo caption 2). As soon as Lalita completed this service, Tundavik rushed on site (see action photo).

I had been dreading Tundavik’s arrival in the new flower beds due to his conditional nature of sampling each variety of flower to evaluate its taste. Moreover, he has never shown sufficient restraint in his habit of sampling the new delicate flower buds. But being equally fond of Tundavik and flowers, I can never find the heart to choose one over the other.

Here in New Vrindaban, wonders abound. To my great delight, I observed that for the first time in his life, Tundavik was happy and content to simply observe (without eating) how the flowers were placed and arranged so beautifully for Krishna’s pleasure. He didn’t eat even a single one!
