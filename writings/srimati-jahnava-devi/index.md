Lord Nityananda’s wife, Srimati Jahnava-devi, has a confidential relationship with Gopinath.

Following the Kheturi festival in Bengal, Jahnava made a pilgrimage to Vraja. During that trip, she visited Radha Kunda (which is located in the region glorified as “Srivan”). At Radha Kunda, Jahnava heard the enchanting song of Gopinath’s flute. As she turned in the direction from which the music emanated, she beheld the all-attractive three-fold bending form of Gopinath.

Later, in 1669, at the height of the ferocious fanaticism of the wicked emperor Aurangzeb, the deities of Sri Sri Radha Gopinath and Ananga Manjari went into hiding at Radha Kunda.

Jahnava established a temple for the deities at Radha Kunda in Bhauma Vrindavan (in India) upon the site where she had previously witnessed the form of Gopinath.

Now, at Radha Kunda in New Vrindavan (in USA), construction of Radha Gopinath Mandir is currently underway. This temple is situated on the bank of Radha Kunda in the same location as the temple established by Jahnava devi in Bhauma Vrindavan - that most sacred place where Srimati Jahnava had witnessed Gopinath playing upon His mischievous flute.
