Rising from the mud below, blossoming from above, the lotus offers the archetypal emblem of beauty, purity, and primordial nature. The lotus is the form Sri Dhama reveals herself in.

It is suitable design for the Lord's internal energy to protect her chastity and maintain her innocence when she condescends to appear within the gaze of mortals.

The individual components of the flower of the lotus of the dhama are significant. The whorl represents Radha and Krishna; petals are the ashta-sakhis: Lalita, Vishaka, Campakalata, Indulekha, Sudevi, Rangadevi, Tungavidya, Citradevi.

The stamen connects the whorl with the petals, holds the pollen and releases or withholds it according to the Lordâ€™s desire. The stamen is the eight manjaris, which are the closest to the whorl. Due to their youthful and innocent nature, they have free and full access to the intimate pastimes of Radha and Krishna. Furthermore, their age is characterized by the emotional intensity of devotional nature, which expresses itself toward jivas as deep and heartfelt compassion.

Sri Braja Dhama rests on the current of Jamuna, her counterpart, Navadvipa Dhama, is a golden lotus floating on the Ganga. Her eight petals are sravanam, kirtanam, vishnu-smaranam, pada-sevanam, archanam, vandanam, dasyam, sakhyam. The whorl is atma-nivedanam, the island of self-surrender, also known as Yogapitha, the heart of Sri Dhama, the place where the Lord appears.

The whorl represents Lord Caitanya; the petals are his main associates. The asta manjaris of Braja become the Six Gosvamis, who are endowed with the most confidential knowledge of the nature of the absolute truth, Lord Caitanya. True to the analogy of the lotus, the stamen releases the pollen, which attracts devotees who are like honey bees. The fragrance of the flower invites pilgrims to enter into the whorl, taste the nectar and distribute it to others. Thus the mercy expands.
