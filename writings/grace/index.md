The life of the great devotes is enriched with the sweetness of loving devotion, humility, and compassion, which attracts our hearts toward Krishna and away from the attachment to material illusion. Krishna cannot resist the heart rending prayers of His devotees. And when they favor us, He takes charge of our lives by activating and orchestrating everything in creation to help bring us home.

We need to revere the lives of the great vaisnavas and immerse ourselves in thoughts of them, their messages and their mercy, which is embodied in their teachings and life's example. We serve them and beg for their blessings; because it is only by the grace, protection and guidance of the pure devotees, that we can ever be led out of the endless labyrinths of material existence.

The mahatmas come to this world to fulfill the will of the Lord, to lift our lives up and place them within a higher and larger picture. They broaden our perception and adjust our focus to perceive a realm of opportunities emerging from what seemed to be a world made of obstacles. And then, that which looked so oppressive before becomes liberating by their enlightening distribution of Radha and Krishna's inherent Grace.
