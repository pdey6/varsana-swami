Our new life of spirituality blossoms inasmuch as our hearts soften in a humble service attitude. It is like springtime flowers emerging from the thawing earth after winter makes way for the appearance of spring.

In New Vrindavan clusters of daffodils encircle Radha Kunda like cups of nectar, offering refreshments to their Queen. The bright yellow flowers, arranged upon a blanket of green petals, happily proclaim that winter is over and spring has begun; old life is gone and a new one awaits. Though a simple and common flower, its early springtime message is significant – a fresh, new beginning. The Lord’s creation is daily inviting us to join them with our participation and creativity.

Bordering the clusters of brilliantly blooming floral arrangements, tiny wildflowers are not so conspicuous, but on closer examination they award a hint of the next phase of upcoming beauty. Their patterns weave in and out of meadows and bowers, swirling like a delicate lace border embellishing the skirt of Mother Earth as she dances with the spirit of spring.

Flowers awaken a service attitude, one integral to our spiritual identity. And though they speak so gently upon the flowing breeze, their message is powerful. “Cultivate and embrace new life!” they say. “Stop focusing so exclusively on past hurts, present circumstances, or future fears. Be present in the here and now, with all the hope, joy, healing and wisdom conveyed in the moment. Blossom!”
