Krishna Consciousness is meant to soften the steel framed heart. The hard layers of pride, enmity, jealousy, cynicism, and criticism cover the heart; thus the soul cannot manifest its natural and gentle qualities. As the anarthas are gradually cleansed, the glorious and devotional nature of the soul can shine through, expressing itself in the full spectrum of kindness, compassion, and love.

What is so essential about the lotus feet of the Lord and his devotees? It is the path they tread in the form of their pastimes and their precepts. To take their dust upon the head means to take their instructions as the most important and precious element of our life. And, it is the dust of the lotus feet of a pure devotee that has the power to melt the steel frame of the heart. Then, Krishna, the butter thief, who is very attracted to a heart which becomes soft and sweet like butter, may desire to steal, enjoy it and make it His home.
