In His fierce mood, Lord Nrsimhadeva conquers the demons, thereby protecting the society of devotees from the onslaught of vicious violence from without. He also protects us from the internal manifestation of these demons as the anarthas (unwanted desires) of lust, anger, greed, pride, illusion and envy. These anarthas torment the mind, choke the bhakti-lata, and cover the spiritual nature of the dham within the heart.

Lord Nrsimhadeva in His gentle, encouraging, and protective mood is very evident for the devotees of New Vrindavan. Our Lord Nrsimhadeva is very special because He appeared here, along with Prahlad Maharaja, after being lovingly crafted by the hands of His devotee Soma das who says, in humility, “The Lord wanted to appear. I just had to assist in Him in His own process of revealing Himself.”
