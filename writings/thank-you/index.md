Krishna is arranging everything to help us come home. Though it might be bitter like a neem leaf, it is nonetheless medicinal, beneficial and helps to cure the disease. The prayer of our heart becomes: ‘Thank you Krishna for whatever you send to me, for you are my kind, loving father, Who sometimes gives rewards and other times punishment. Only You know what is good for me, surely I do not and you try to help me as I turn to you”.

Such an attitude defies the false ego and welcome Krishna to enter our heart and dispel the darkness within. When the mind rebels, saying “you mean I should say thank you for something I don't like?” we need to realize who is dictating in our life, whether it is false ego or Krishna.

Expressing “thanks” in every moment and every experience that life offers nourishes the inner transformation from resentment to gratitude. Every “thank you” felt and expressed contributes to the growth of a spirit of gratitude.

Regardless of whether a situation seems pleasurable or painful, whether tears are shed from joy or distress, devotees offer everything to Krishna in faith that His arrangements are most perfect. Not that we shirk responsibility to correct injustices, inappropriate attitudes or behavior. If our Krsna consciousness is to prevail, our action and intercession need to participate with the Lords' loving presence and compassionate nature.
