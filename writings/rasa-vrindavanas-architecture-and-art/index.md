Sri Krishna is the Source, Object and Abode of rasa. It is inherent within Him, He knows and feels it yet He cannot relish it, for the flavor He (and everyone) aspires to taste can only be experienced in the exchange, the sharing, and the reciprocation of love.

Sri Radha is the one who draws out the rasa from within Sri Krishna, inaugurating its flow and directing its course according to the pleasure of Her beloved and the benefit of all His servants.

Rasa is fluid and as all its metaphors proclaim and it is conscious as well. Furthermore it infuses consciousness of Vraja bhakti into everyone and everything it touches whether directly or indirectly. Thus in the realm where rasa prevails, ecstasy expresses itself in words which form song and steps which lead to dance.

Within the effulgence expending from Radha and Krishna’s pastimes Rasa educes endless patterns to evolve into unprecedented ecstatic wonders. Thus the art and architecture characteristic of Vraja demonstrate unique style, which offers visible expression to the subtle dynamics which permeate the atmosphere of Krishna’s heartland. In landscape where the aesthetics of Vraja assume visible and tangible expression, the subtle and dormant origins of our purpose and goal of life are revived, a stirring in the soul is experienced, our bhakti is fortified, our thirst for rasa finds reciprocation and fulfillment.

Srila Prabhupada envisioned a replica of Vraja in the West to be named New Vrindavana an essential component of his mission. He desired that the wonders of Vraja be expanded in the West as the foundation of his “cultural conquest”. His vision included replica of the 7 major temples whose unique decorative patterns of pathways, arches, lattice and domes awaken remembrance of our homeland along with yearning to return to that place where all our dormant aspirations blossom into full-blown expression through service to the well-spring of rasa and fountainhead of bhakti.
