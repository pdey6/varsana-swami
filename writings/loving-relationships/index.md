An experience of Krishna and taste of devotional service is proportional to the spiritual quality of our relationships. The Lord is irresistibly drawn to loving dealings between devotees. He reveals Himself in and through loving relationships, for which He is the source and the hope.

Vaisnava relations mean that Krishna is in the center and between us; He is in our every thought and every act. Without the Lord being the pivotal point of all our daily interactions, our needs turn into demands; looking tenderly turns into looking suspiciously, hearing becomes insinuating. Relationships which are based on humble service and commitment are living testimony to the Lord's love for us. They create a sacred space where Krishna can reside and reveal to us the sweet and attractive nature of His eternal abode.
